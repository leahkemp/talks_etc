Genetics plays an important role in many diseases afflicting New Zealanders. Currently, genetic testing typically involves gene panels (testing multiple genes involved in a disorder the patient is suspected to have) or testing for variation in chromosomal structure and number. But! Beyond what can be detected in these tests, there is an incredible amount of information that is available within a person’s genome that has powerful diagnostic and treatment implications.

This is the threshold where clinical genetics becomes clinical genomics, where the entire genome of a patient is sequenced and interpreted (around 20,000 to 25,000 genes - rather than a few genes in each gene panel). At ESR, we have pushed past this boundary, adopting established practices and infrastructure used overseas.

This has seen us work collaboratively with the Capital & Coast District Health Board (CCDHB) as a part of the Genomics Aotearoa Clinical Genomics project. The first hurdle was building bioinformatics capacity in New Zealand. I was hired with bioinformatics upskilling in mind, and I’ve begun to ‘pass on the torch’ by teaching workshops and presenting my work.

We built analysis pipelines based on best practices in bioinformatics, utilising workflow languages, software containers and conda environments meaning the bioinformatics can be standardised New Zealand wide. These analysis pipelines are running on cutting edge NVIDA GPU’s in HPC environment that analyse genomes in a few hours rather than up to two days. When demand for clinical genomics expands, we can scale up by buying more GPU’s, the software is ready to adapt.

We have the capacity for clinical exome sequencing (targeted sequencing of all the genes in a genome) at ESR’s Porirua branch. However, we envision a future where clinical genome sequencing (the complete genome) can be done onshore. Then we can go from sample collection to clinical interpretation in days instead of months or years, an important speedup for patients experiencing disease.

We have already had a potential diagnosis of an individual who was unable to be diagnosed through years of traditional testing. This continues to spur us on to make clinical genomics accessible to all New Zealanders.
