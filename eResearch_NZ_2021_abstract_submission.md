# Building New Zealands clinical genomics capacity

## [eResearch NZ 2021](https://www.eresearchnz2021.org.nz/) abstract submission

Genetics plays an important role in many diseases afflicting New Zealanders. Currently, genetic testing involves testing a few genes at a time or testing for variation in chromosomal structure and number. However, there is much more information available within a person’s genome that has powerful diagnostic and treatment implications. This is where clinical genetics becomes clinical genomics!

The Human Genomics group at ESR has been working in collaboration with the Capital & Coast District Health Board (CCDHB) to build New Zealands clinical genomics capacity by adopting established practices and infrastructure used overseas. We built open source analysis pipelines based on best practices in bioinformatics. These utilise workflow languages and portable software allowing the analysis of genomic data to be standardised New Zealand wide. They run on cutting edge NVIDA GPU’s in HPC environment that massively speed up the analysis. When demand for clinical genomics expands, we can scale up with more GPU’s, the software is ready to adapt.

We envision a future where clinical genome sequencing can be done in New Zealand. Then we can go from sample collection to clinical interpretation in days instead of months or years, a crucial speedup for patients managing disease. We have already had a potential diagnosis of an individual who was unable to be diagnosed through years of traditional testing a story that continues to spur us on to make clinical genomics and precision medicine accessible to all New Zealanders.
